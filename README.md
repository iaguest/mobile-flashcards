# mobile-flashcards
WORK IN PROGRESS

A mobile application for Android and iOS that allows users to study collections of flashcards. The app allows users to create different categories of flashcards called "decks", to add flashcards to those decks and then take quizzes on those decks.

This app was built using react-native.
